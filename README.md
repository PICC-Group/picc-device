# Code for processing nanoVNA prameters for controlling RC car.
This code is devoloped by The PICC Group at Lund University for the 2024 IEEE AP-S Student Design Contest. The purpose is to process signals from a nanoVNA-setup to controll a RC car. The S-parameters S11 and S21 are inputs and the code will return a distance and angle continuously. A web app is launched creating an interface showing angle, distance, other system data and possible system/setup configuration settings.
